     Line: Your Link to the Fish
     We suggest starting with 8-pound test monoflament line.
     People sometimes use lighter line to cast farther or to get
     more bites from skittish fsh or heavier lines to pull out
     of snags, but 8-pound test line is a good compromise for
     most fsh. Choose clear, light blue or green line for your
     starting outft.
         Check your reel or the instructions that came with it to
     determine how much 8-pound-test line it will hold. Usually
                                                                                                                        Fish: David Stonner; Tackle Box: Clif White




     a 100-yard spool is large enough to fll a medium-light reel.
         Follow the instructions that come with your reel and
     line before flling. The reel is full when the wrapped line is
     about 1/8 inch from the outside edge of the spool. Don’t
     allow knots in your line, except at the end. Knots both
     weaken line and make it difcult to cast.

     How A Drag Works
     Fishing reels have a drag to prevent the weight
     and pull of a fsh from snapping the line,
     making it possible to land even large fsh with
     light lines.
        Before fshing, set the drag to release line
     before the breaking point of the line is reached.
        When a big fsh is pulling, line will come of
     the reel, sometimes making a clicking sound.
     Learn to recognize when the drag is letting a
     fsh run and don’t reel during that time, or your
     line will twist. Avoid the temptation to tighten
     the drag while fghting a fsh.
                                                                                                                             Clif White

             Finer Points
             All anglers do not cast alike. As you fsh, you will develop     • Longer rods generally allow you to cast farther, if they

             to improve your casting:                                        • Casting into a strong wind requires a lower trajectory,
             • Accuracy is often more important than distance. Many            which is achieved by releasing the line slightly later in
                 fsh remain near protective cover and will strike only         the forward part of the cast.
                 those lures that come into their immediate vicinity.        • If your lure bounces or skitters across the water, you are
             • Improve your accuracy by casting to defnite targets,            releasing the line too late. Release earlier for a higher
                 even while on the water. Make sure you focus on your          trajectory. Remember the bouncing technique, though,
                 target while casting.                                         for you may someday want to skip your lure under a

                 by lifting the rod so that the line drags against the end     holding the rod too tightly. Use the minimum amount

                 than a cast. Increase slightly the distance between           especially in your wrist. The lighter the grip, the more

Rigging Up
Now that you’ve acquired some fshing gear and learned
how to cast, it’s time to arm your fshing pole for action.
The end of your line is the scene of all the action. Here
you’ll tie a hook or lure and, perhaps, fasten on split shot
sinkers, swivels, or bobbers.
   Use the improved clinch to tie on hooks and lures.

Improved Clinch Knot                                                Rubber Grip         Egg        Bullet        Split Shot
There are dozens of diferent knots, but most anglers
settle on one or two favorite knots to tie line to reels,
hooks, swivels, and lures. The improved clinch knot is           5. Pull on both the line and the tag end to tighten

                                                                 together more smoothly if you moisten the line with saliva
1. Run the end of the line through the eye of a hook             before tightening. Trim the tag end about 1/4 inch away
about 6 inches and fold it back on itself.                       from the knot.
2. Leaving a loop (Loop 1) near the eye, wrap the end of
the line around the standing (or long piece of line held in                        Finished Knot
your hand) about fve complete turns.

                                                                 fsh. Crappie and many other panfsh often swim a few feet
                                                                 beneath the surface, and a bobber will hold your bait up
                                                                 where the fsh can see it.
3. Pass the end back up through Loop 1 (the loop beside             Generally, use the lightest tackle you can. Holding your
the eye). This creates another loop (Loop 2) between the         bait on the bottom of a pond on a calm day, for example,

                       Loop 2                                    sampling your bait.
                                                      Standing      Similarly, use a small bobber and balance it with
                                                        Cord
              Loop 1                                             enough split shot beneath that the fsh can pull your

    Hooks come in many sizes and shapes. An ideal hook
is one that is small enough to slip into a fsh’s mouth, yet

large enough to hold its lip securely. Hooks are measured
with a numbering system that runs from No. 20 to No. 0 —
the bigger the number, the smaller the hook. For example,                              Oversized Plug
a No. 20 hook is much smaller than a No. 6 hook.                                 p
    When fshing with natural or live bait, a package with
an assortment of hooks ranging from sizes No. 6 through
No. 10 is good to have. However, when fshing for catfsh
or other large fsh, larger hooks are needed, such as No. 2
through No. 6. Trout fshing requires small hooks in the No.
14 to No. 20 range.

Aberdeen Hook
The Aberdeen hook has an elongated shank and wide
gap. Mostly used with worms, minnows, and insect larvae,                                   Crankbaits
the Aberdeen allows for easy removal from a fsh, as the
shank is usually visible for easy access. This hook is a good
beginner’s hook. The long shank helps anglers get a safer
feel for unhooking fsh, and baiting is easier than if using
short-shank hooks.

Bait-holder Hook
Bait-holder hooks are recognizable by a series of two
or more barbs on the shank. Anglers who fsh with
nightcrawlers often use them. These barbs help hold the
worms on the shank. This keeps bait on the hook longer
                                                                                                        Hooks: Clif White; Spoons, Crankbaits, Flies: David Stonner

Treble Hook
The treble hook is actually three single hooks stuck
together. Used most often with lures, but are also used to
hold doughbait or stinkbait because they hold soft bait
better than single hooks.

Common Missouri Fishes
Largemouth Bass
Largemouth bass are plentiful in lakes and
ponds. Even a small pond may hold big fsh.
They often hold near cover, such as aquatic
vegetation, docks, or timber. Bass eat fsh,
crayfsh, large insects, and occasionally, frogs,
mice, snakes, or other small animals. Adult bass
commonly run 10 to 20 inches.


Smallmouth Bass
Smallmouth bass can be found in cool, clear
streams and large lakes primarily in southern
Missouri. They prefer structure, such as rocks,
where they can fnd fsh, crayfsh and aquatic
insects to eat. Adult bass commonly run 10 to 18
inches.


White Bass
White bass inhabit the deeper pools of streams
and the open waters of lakes and reservoirs.
They feed primarily on other fsh, but also may
eat emerging aquatic insects. Adult white bass
commonly run 9 to 15 inches.


Bluegill/Sunfsh
Found in ponds, lakes, and streams, bluegills
and sunfsh thrive in warm, clear water with
aquatic vegetation and insects. They often feed
in shallow water and can be caught on worms,
crickets, or fies. Average size is about 6 inches.


Channel Catfsh
Channel catfsh live in ponds, lakes, and streams,
and bite on a variety of live, cut or prepared
baits fshed on the bottom. The best fshing is at

Flathead Catfsh
Flathead catfsh can be found in reservoirs or
large streams with slow current. During the day,
they prefer deeper water or cover. At night they
move into rifes and shallow areas to feed upon
other fsh and crayfsh. Adults commonly run 15
to 45 inches.
                                                                                                 Joseph Tomelleri

                   Carp
                   Carp prefer shallow water and feed on plant
                   and animal material. They bite best on worms,
                   canned corn, and dough balls. Carp usually
                   range from 1 to 8 pounds, but often grow much
                   larger. Their fesh is bony, but favorful.


                   White Crappie
                   Crappie usually prefer cover, such as brush piles
                   placed by anglers, and submerged trees. They
                   bite best on small jigs or minnows fshed slowly
                   and sometimes quite deep. These popular food
                   fsh usually run from 9 to 11 inches.


                   Goggle-eye
                   Goggle-eye, or rock bass, live in Ozark streams.
                   They prefer nooks and crannies of root wads
                   and undercut rocks in running water. They feed
                   on crayfsh, small fsh and aquatic insects. Adult
                   goggle-eye commonly run up to 11 inches.


                   Golden Redhorse
                   Golden redhorse can be found primarily in
                   Ozark and northeast Missouri streams. These
                   bottom feeders prefer the deeper pools of clear,
                   gravelly rivers and streams, where they feed on
                   aquatic insects. Adults commonly run 9 to 15
                   inches.


                   Rainbow Trout
                   Trout prefer cool, fowing water, but some are
                   stocked in lakes in winter for anglers to catch.
                   They bite on worms and insects and are a
                   favorite of fy fshers. Trout typically range from
                   10 to 16 inches.


                   Walleye
                   Walleye are native to large rivers and streams
                   in Missouri and have been stocked in reservoirs
                   and selected streams. They feed on a variety of
                   fsh, including shad. They prefer deeper pools
                   with rocky or submerged log cover in rivers,
                   and creek channels and drop-ofs in lakes and
                   reservoirs. Adult walleye commonly run 12 to 28
                   inches.

              Setting the Hook
              When you suspect a bite, have your rod pointed in the
              direction of the bait or lure with no slack in the line.
              Setting the hook calls for a sharp backward and upward
              movement of the rod. Fish have tough mouths, so it takes
              a good sharp action to set the hook. Sharp hooks help
              ensure that the hook sets well.
                  Beginning anglers sometimes set their hook too
              hard, which can break their line, straighten their hook, or
              pull the hook out of the fsh’s mouth. If your drag is set
              correctly, you can set the hook vigorously. Stretch in your
              line, the drag, and the bend of the fshing rod will absorb
              much of the pressure of the strike to keep from ripping the
              hook out.

              Playing the Fish
              After the hook is set, anglers should hold their rod tip high,
              keeping pressure on the fsh. This will keep the fsh’s head
              up and will help keep the line tight. Keeping the fsh’s head
              up is important because it reduces the chance of the fsh
              getting tangled in rocks, vegetation, or other structures.
              Keeping the line tight is important because it helps keep
              the hook embedded in the fsh’s mouth. If a fsh senses
              slack in the line, it may have a chance to shake the hook
              free, especially if the hook isn’t set well.                      or eyes or squeeze them too hard. Leave the fsh in the

caught over and over again. They grow large and produce
even more fsh for our pleasure.
    There is nothing wrong with keeping fsh to eat, so long
as you obey regulations. On the other hand, give every
fsh you release, even small fsh and nontarget species, the
respect of careful handling.
    Good catch-and-release technique begins even before
you catch a fsh. Choose lines and equipment that will
bring fsh in quickly, so they don’t exhaust all their energy
in a prolonged battle. Fish often deeply swallow live bait,
which can make releasing the fsh unharmed difcult. Use
artifcial lures in favor of live bait if you plan to catch and
release fsh. Fish that hit artifcial baits are less likely to be
hooked deeply enough to damage vital organs and have a
high survival rate.

             Cleaning
             Cleaning fsh is easy after a little practice. You can clean
             fsh on a dock, paddle, cooler lid or fat rock. Many fshing
             accesses and parks provide fsh cleaning stations with
             water for rinsing fsh.
                Handy fsh cleaning tools include a sharp knife, a scaler
             and a glove to protect your hand and help grip the fsh.
             Cleaning fsh on old newspaper will make clean-up easy.

   Observe all fshing regulations. Length limits, seasons,
daily or possession limits, and restrictions on methods are
part of the overall management of the fsheries. The future
of fshing requires anglers to heed regulations.

Fishing Permit
Everyone over the age of 15 and under the age of 65
must have a permit to fsh in Missouri. The exceptions are
residents and members of their households fshing on
waters completely enclosed by their property and people
with certifable disabilities. On some specially managed
waters, such as trout parks, anglers also need a daily tag.
Daily, annual, and lifetime permits are available. See the
current A Summary of Missouri Fishing Regulations for
details, or go to mdc.mo.gov.

General Rules
Length limits, daily limits, and seasons vary somewhat on
specially managed bodies of water. Specifc rules can be
found in the fshing regulations and are often posted at
accesses and fshing areas. Several general rules apply to
most angling situations:
• Rod and reel anglers are limited to three unlabeled
   poles at one time.
• The fsh you keep must be kept separate or identifable
   from fsh taken by another person.
